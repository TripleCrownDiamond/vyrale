## üêõ Troubleshooting / Common Issues

### NPM ERESOLVE Error with `react-day-picker`

**Symptom:**

When running `npm install`, you might encounter an `ERESOLVE` error similar to the following:

```bash
npm error code ERESOLVE
npm error ERESOLVE could not resolve
npm error
npm error While resolving: react-day-picker@8.10.1
npm error Found: react@19.1.0
npm error node_modules/react
npm error   react@"^19.0.0" from the root project
...
npm error Could not resolve dependency:
npm error peer react@"^16.8.0 || ^17.0.0 || ^18.0.0" from react-day-picker@8.10.1
npm error node_modules/react-day-picker
npm error   react-day-picker@"^8.10.1" from the root project
```

**Cause:**

This error occurs because `react-day-picker@8.10.1` has a peer dependency on an older version of React (e.g., `^16.8.0 || ^17.0.0 || ^18.0.0`), while the project is using a newer version (e.g., `react@19.1.0` as specified in `package.json`).

**Solution:**

To bypass this peer dependency conflict, you can use the `--legacy-peer-deps` flag with npm install:

```bash
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
```

This command tells npm to ignore peer dependencies and proceed with the installation. While this can resolve the immediate issue, be aware that it might lead to unexpected behavior if the installed package is truly incompatible with the newer version of its peer dependency. It's generally recommended to look for updated versions of packages that are compatible with your project's dependencies.

```

**Cause:**

This error occurs because `react-day-picker@8.10.1` has a peer dependency on an older version of React (e.g., `^16.8.0 || ^17.0.0 || ^18.0.0`), while the project is using a newer version (e.g., `react@19.1.0` as specified in `package.json`).

**Solution:**

To bypass this peer dependency conflict, you can use the `--legacy-peer-deps` flag with npm install:

```bash
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
```

This command tells npm to ignore peer dependencies and proceed with the installation. While this can resolve the immediate issue, be aware that it might lead to unexpected behavior if the installed package is truly incompatible with the newer version of its peer dependency. It's generally recommended to look for updated versions of packages that are compatible with your project's dependencies.

npm error node_modules/react-day-picker
npm error   react-day-picker@"^8.10.1" from the root project
```

**Cause:**

This error occurs because `react-day-picker@8.10.1` has a peer dependency on an older version of React (e.g., `^16.8.0 || ^17.0.0 || ^18.0.0`), while the project is using a newer version (e.g., `react@19.1.0` as specified in `package.json`).

**Solution:**

To bypass this peer dependency conflict, you can use the `--legacy-peer-deps` flag with npm install:

```bash
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
```

This command tells npm to ignore peer dependencies and proceed with the installation. While this can resolve the immediate issue, be aware that it might lead to unexpected behavior if the installed package is truly incompatible with the newer version of its peer dependency. It's generally recommended to look for updated versions of packages that are compatible with your project's dependencies.

```

**Cause:**

This error occurs because `react-day-picker@8.10.1` has a peer dependency on an older version of React (e.g., `^16.8.0 || ^17.0.0 || ^18.0.0`), while the project is using a newer version (e.g., `react@19.1.0` as specified in `package.json`).

**Solution:**

To bypass this peer dependency conflict, you can use the `--legacy-peer-deps` flag with npm install:

```bash
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
```

This command tells npm to ignore peer dependencies and proceed with the installation. While this can resolve the immediate issue, be aware that it might lead to unexpected behavior if the installed package is truly incompatible with the newer version of its peer dependency. It's generally recommended to look for updated versions of packages that are compatible with your project's dependencies.

npm error node_modules/react-day-picker
npm error   react-day-picker@"^8.10.1" from the root project
```

**Cause:**

This error occurs because `react-day-picker@8.10.1` has a peer dependency on an older version of React (e.g., `^16.8.0 || ^17.0.0 || ^18.0.0`), while the project is using a newer version (e.g., `react@19.1.0` as specified in `package.json`).

**Solution:**

To bypass this peer dependency conflict, you can use the `--legacy-peer-deps` flag with npm install:

```bash
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
```

This command tells npm to ignore peer dependencies and proceed with the installation. While this can resolve the immediate issue, be aware that it might lead to unexpected behavior if the installed package is truly incompatible with the newer version of its peer dependency. It's generally recommended to look for updated versions of packages that are compatible with your project's dependencies.

| Text generation | Open Source LLMs (LLaMA 3, Mistral 7B, Dolphin, etc.) |
| Image generation | Stable Diffusion (SDXL, 1.5) via HuggingFace or Replicate API |
| Automation | n8n.io workflows, Trae AI IDE agents |

**Strategy:**

- Use open models locally or via free hosting (Replicate/HuggingFace)
- Only fallback to commercial APIs (OpenAI, Anthropic) if absolutely necessary

**Extended AI Content Management:**

- Images generated must be **editable** via an internal **editor**: change fonts, font sizes, reposition logos, edit text overlays.
- A custom lightweight **AI-powered editor** (similar to Canva) will be developed for visual post editing.
- Future scaling will allow editing of **generated videos** similarly.
- Inputs from external content sources (e.g., blog articles, Spotify stats for artists) will be supported to automatically create promotional visuals.
- Users will be able to **upload their own images and videos** instead of relying only on AI generation.
- Contact links, personal branding elements, and CTAs will be editable and added easily.

npm error node_modules/react-day-picker
npm error   react-day-picker@"^8.10.1" from the root project
```

**Cause:**

This error occurs because `react-day-picker@8.10.1` has a peer dependency on an older version of React (e.g., `^16.8.0 || ^17.0.0 || ^18.0.0`), while the project is using a newer version (e.g., `react@19.1.0` as specified in `package.json`).

**Solution:**

To bypass this peer dependency conflict, you can use the `--legacy-peer-deps` flag with npm install:

```bash
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
```

This command tells npm to ignore peer dependencies and proceed with the installation. While this can resolve the immediate issue, be aware that it might lead to unexpected behavior if the installed package is truly incompatible with the newer version of its peer dependency. It's generally recommended to look for updated versions of packages that are compatible with your project's dependencies.

npm error ERESOLVE could not resolve
npm error
npm error While resolving: react-day-picker@8.10.1
npm error Found: react@19.1.0
npm error node_modules/react
npm error   react@"^19.0.0" from the root project
...
npm error Could not resolve dependency:
npm error peer react@"^16.8.0 || ^17.0.0 || ^18.0.0" from react-day-picker@8.10.1
npm error node_modules/react-day-picker
npm error   react-day-picker@"^8.10.1" from the root project
```

**Cause:**

This error occurs because `react-day-picker@8.10.1` has a peer dependency on an older version of React (e.g., `^16.8.0 || ^17.0.0 || ^18.0.0`), while the project is using a newer version (e.g., `react@19.1.0` as specified in `package.json`).

**Solution:**

To bypass this peer dependency conflict, you can use the `--legacy-peer-deps` flag with npm install:

```bash
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
```

This command tells npm to ignore peer dependencies and proceed with the installation. While this can resolve the immediate issue, be aware that it might lead to unexpected behavior if the installed package is truly incompatible with the newer version of its peer dependency. It's generally recommended to look for updated versions of packages that are compatible with your project's dependencies.
